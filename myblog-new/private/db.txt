Vancouver
Vancouver might be Canada’s third biggest city, but you’ve got to get out of the urban center and into nature. 
It’s on the ocean, is replete with parks and beaches, and there are mountains nearby for hiking in summer and skiing in winter. 
All in all, there’s an overwhelming number of outdoor activities to enjoy, including but not limited to sailing, whale watching, 
salmon fishing, ziplining, kayaking, swimming, paddle boarding, and biking.
Welcome to Stanley Park, Vancouver's first, largest, and most beloved urban park!
